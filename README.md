# Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40"> I'm Juan JosÃ© Farina

## Software Engineer with experience in MLOps and Web Development

I'm a 33 years old software engineer from Rosario, Argentina. My life has always gone from intellectual activities like problem-solving, puzzles, videogames, maths, computers and loving to study and learn, to loving high performance in physical activities, like sports, gymnastics and dancing.

I'm a developer since 2010 (Bachelor in 'Analista de Sistemas de ComputaciÃ³n'), but I changed to dance as a profession in 2012. Dance has taught me lots about perseverance, discipline, creativity, collaboration, hard-work and commitment.

Right now I'm working as a MLOps Engineer at PwC and I'm also leading a Web Development project for an e-learning platform for Academia Rosario Ballet.

### ðŸš€ My recent projects:

- **PwC**: while I can't show my work at PwC, I've worked in the end-to-end development of big ML projects from scratch and up to deployment to 5 different environments (Dev, QA, UAT, Stage and Prod) to as many as 3 different world regions for each (except Dev and QA). Worked in multinational teams and implemented the highest code quality standards and novel automated systems for Semantic Releases and Breaking Change Detections.
- **E-Learning Platform for ARB**: currently leading a full development team with 4 front-end developers, 4 back-end developers and 3 UX/UI designers.
- **My Portfolio** (https://juanjfarina.github.io/portfolio): this is my portfolio and, besides beeing able to see my other projects and related info, the portfolio itself was a project for showcasing some of my Front-End skills: it's built using Bootstrap and React and has many small effects, animations and hidden easter eggs.
- **Website for ARB** (https://www.academiarosarioballet.com.ar): this was my last website before updating my knowledge with new techs and development paradigms. It's built on vanilla JS with Bootstrap, AJAX, PHP and MySQL. It features a wide variety of implementations, from registration, login, dashboard, student's task to complete online, an online library with PDF visualization and a video gallery, both of these with many searching filters.
- **Meta Capstone Project** (https://juanjfarin.github.io): this is the final assignment of the Meta Professional Certification, I had to build the homepage and booking table pages of the Little Lemon website alongside every component and style, based on a Figma wireframe and UI kit. The site is build taking into consideration the correct use of semantic HTML5, role ARIAS and inputs validations. It's made with Bootstrap and React, using also Formik and Yup.
