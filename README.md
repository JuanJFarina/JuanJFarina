# Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40"> I'm Juan JosÃ© Farina

## Software Engineer with experience in MLOps and Web Development

I'm from Rosario, Argentina ! My life has always gone from intellectual activities like problem-solving, puzzles, videogames, maths, computers and loving to study and learn, to loving high performance in physical activities, like sports, gymnastics and dancing.

I'm a developer since 2010 (Bachelor in 'Analista de Sistemas de ComputaciÃ³n'), but I changed to dance as a profession in 2012. Dance has taught me lots about perseverance, discipline, creativity, collaboration, hard-work and commitment.

Right now I'm working as a MLOps Engineer at PwC and I'm also leading a few Web Development projects for Academia Rosario Ballet.

### ðŸ’» My Tech-Toolkit:
- **Best Practices**: Heavy use of unit tests, typing, formatters, linters, different design patterns like Strategy, Facade, Factory, Information Expert, etc., and a good balance of legibility and efficience.
- **Languages**: Mostly Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, as well as some experience in many others.
- **MLOps**: Azure, Databricks, MLFlow, Numpy, PySpark, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn, Tensorflow/Keras, etc.
- **Frontend**: Mostly React and Angular, but I've made some developments in Next, jQuery, etc, even using libraries like Three.js.
- **Style**: I've used many CSS libraries/frameworks, like Styled-Components, Bootstrap, and MaterialUI.
- **Backend**: I've done some developments using Express, Nest, FastAPI and PHP.
- **Databases**: Mostly used MongoDB, but also some MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **Tools and Techs**: Good knowledge of Git, Bash, Docker, and other tools.
- **CI/CD**: Heavy use of Azure Pipelines, implementing many building, deploying and analysis tools, as well as Infrastructure as Code using JSON and Jinja.

### ðŸš€ My recent work and projects:

- **PwC**: while I can't show my work at PwC, I've worked since October 2023 in the development of big ML projects from scratch and up to deployment to 5 different environments and 3 different world regions for each. In my first six months I gained two recognition awards for my work. I've been part of multinational teams and I've implemented the highest code quality standards and novel automated systems for Git Stats Reports, Semantic Releases and Breaking Change Detections, among others.
- **Git-Report-Stats**: as a way to improve communication and transparency between developers, POs/PMs and other stakeholders, I co-authored a reporting tool that shows the different authors and contributions to a project for any given timelapse or from the latest merge. The tool has been published to PyPI and is used in our CI/CDs.
- **Hand-Mouse**: as a fun side-project, I decided to make a simple tracking app that allows the use of hand-gestures as a mouse, and also has voice-recognition to either stop or start capturing the gestures. It's really fun and useful !
- **E-Learning Platform for ARB**: currently leading a full development team with 4 front-end developers, 4 back-end developers and 3 UX/UI designers.
