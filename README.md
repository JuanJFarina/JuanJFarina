# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juan JosÃ© Farina

## Full-Stack Developer | Software Engineer

I'm 32 years old and I'm looking for a career change; my life has always gone from intellectual activities like problem-solving, puzzles, videogames, maths, computers and loving to study and learn, to physical activities like sports and dancing.

I'm a developer since 2010 (Bachelor in 'Analista de Sistemas de ComputaciÃ³n'), but I don't have formal experience because I changed to dance as a profession in 2013. Nevertheless, I think that profession taught me lots about perseverance, discipline, creativity, collaboration, hard-work and commitment.

Right now I'm looking for a mid-point, and I've realized I want to reach my full potential in the IT world, gain a better life style, be able to have a happy family, and who knows ? Maybe even relocate. Whatever it is, I know I have a lot of potential and I want to give my all.

### ðŸ’» My tech stack is:

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass
- **Backend**: Node.js, PHP, JAVA
- **Databases**: MySQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Git
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Other**: Git, Agile/Scrum, RESTful APIs

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning:

- DevOps (CI/CD, Development Pipelines and automation, etc.)
- Cloud Software Engineer (Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, SaaS, etc.)
- Agile / Scrum methodologies
- Python, Express.js and MongoDB

### ðŸš€ My recent projects:

- Academia Rosario Ballet (https://www.academiarosarioballet.com.ar): this was my last website before updating my knowledge with new techs and development paradigms. It's built on vanilla JS with Bootstrap, AJAX, PHP and MySQL. It features a wide variety of implementations, from registration, login, dashboard, student's task to complete online, an online library with PDF visualization and a video gallery, both of these with many searching filters.
